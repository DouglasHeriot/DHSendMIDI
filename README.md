# DHSendMIDI

DHSendMIDI is a simple tool for sending MIDI messages from a command line

## Sounds awesome! Downloads?

There’s no prebuilt downloads just yet (I’ll get to that soon when it’s ready for general use)

## Getting the Code

Note it uses SnoizeMIDI from a submodule, so clone recursively:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/DouglasHeriot/DHSendMIDI.git

## License

DHSendMIDI has a BSD-style license. See the file LICENSE.md
